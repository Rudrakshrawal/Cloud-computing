# Cloud-computing
- Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence-over the Internet ("the cloud") to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale

# Hyperscalars  :
A hyperscaler is a type of large-scale data center that offers massive computing resources, typically in the form of an elastic cloud platform. Organizations use them to deploy and manage large-scale applications and services.


- ## Benefits
- • Faster time to market
- • Scalability and flexibility
- - Horizontal scaling involves adding more machines or nodes to a system, while vertical scaling involves adding more power (CPU, RAM, storage, etc.) to an existing machine![image](https://github.com/Rudrakshrawal/Cloud-computing/assets/144530387/fedab9a2-767c-453f-bdc1-8acd27dcbf87)
  - Soft Limits or Quotas - AWS allows users to set service-specific limits, also known as soft limits or quotas, on various resources such as EC2 instances, EBS volumes, or other services.

These soft limits are preconfigured limits on how much of a particular resource you can use within your AWS account. They are set by default to prevent accidental overuse of resources, which could potentially lead to unexpected charges or performance issues.

- • Cost savings
- • Better collaboration
- • Advanced security
- • Data loss prevention


- # Disadvantages
-  • risk of vendor lock-in
-  • less control over underlying cloud infrastructure
-  • concerns about security risks like data privacy and online threats
-  • integration complexity with existing systems
-  • unforeseen costs and unexpected expenses

 # Hybrid cloud 
 - A hybrid cloud is a mixed computing environment where applications are run using a combination of computing, storage, and services in different environments ![image](https://github.com/Rudrakshrawal/Cloud-computing/assets/144530387/7eb094a6-917a-4266-9377-a5f2dcad622c) (During big billions sale flipkart can add the extra load on the public cloud and the usual load on the private cloud representing a use cse of hybrid cloud)

# Cloud Service Model
• laaS
• PaaS
• SaaS

# Compute Services
- • Elastic Compute Cloud - EC2
- • ECS / EKS - Containerized Services
- • Lambda - Serverless(refers to a way of building and running applications without needing to manage the underlying servers. Instead, developers focus solely on writing and deploying code, rest is done by cloud provider.)

# Storage Services
- • Simple Storage Service - S3
- • Elastic Block Store - EBS
- • Elastic File System - EFS
- • Archival Service - Glacier
-  **(Object storage stores and manages all data in an unstructured format and in units called objects. Block storage takes any data, like a file or database entry, and divides it into blocks of equal sizes. It then stores the data block on underlying physical storage in a way that's optimized for fast access and retrieval.)**
